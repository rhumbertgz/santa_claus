# SantaClaus

This is an Elixir solution to the classic Santa Claus Problem. This implementation is based on the Erlang solution of Richard A. O'Keefe (http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/ok/santa/santa.erl)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `santa_claus` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:santa_claus, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/santa_claus](https://hexdocs.pm/santa_claus).
